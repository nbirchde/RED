Perfect. I’ll dive into research on top Spanish-speaking therapy platforms—both in Europe and South America—and compare their features, UX design, and matching systems with RED. I'll also create a detailed README in Markdown with clear programming directives, including frontend/backend architecture, tech stack, database structure, and UX best practices focused on smooth psychological flow and usability.

I'll get back to you with a full competitive breakdown and a development blueprint ready to hand off to a programmer.

# RED Digital Therapy Platform – Competitive Analysis & Development Blueprint

## Introduction  
Online therapy has gained significant traction across Spanish-speaking regions, with multiple platforms emerging to connect clients to licensed psychologists via the web. In Latin America alone, over **22% of the population suffered mental health disorders as of 2017**, a figure likely higher today after pandemic-related stress ([LatAm Startups That Focus On Mental Health •](https://contxto.com/en/news/latam-startups-that-focus-on-mental-health/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CIt%20seems%20that%20anxiety%20is,WHO)). Platforms like **Terapify** in Mexico, **TherapyChat** (now rebranded as *Therapyside*) in Spain, and newer entrants such as **Selia**, **CuidadosaMENTE**, and **TerapiaMía** have arisen to meet this demand. This document provides an in-depth competitive analysis of these digital therapy platforms – focusing on user experience, matching, design, payments, community features, and automation – and compares them to the vision for **RED** (a new therapy platform). Based on these insights and internal specifications from **RED’s technical docs**, a comprehensive development blueprint for RED is then outlined. The goal is to prioritize an ergonomic flow, strong UX with psychological sensitivity, and high automation potential in RED’s design.

## Competitive Analysis of Spanish-Language Therapy Platforms  

### User Experience & Onboarding  
Leading Spanish-language therapy platforms emphasize a smooth onboarding process for clients to minimize the fear or confusion of starting therapy. **Terapify**’s team found that *“users struggle to choose their ideal psychologist as they are unfamiliar with therapeutic models”* ([Terapify — M.](https://www.milimejia.com/work/terapify#:~:text=Users%20struggle%20to%20choose%20their,one%20best%20suits%20their%20needs)). In response, Terapify implemented an intuitive onboarding questionnaire to guide users toward an appropriate therapist based on their needs. The platform even provides supplemental wellness content (e.g. mindfulness sessions, yoga videos) to support users from the start of their journey ([Terapify — M.](https://www.milimejia.com/work/terapify#:~:text=personalized%2C%20providing%20users%20with%20tools,throughout%20their%20mental%20health%20journey)). Similarly, **TherapyChat/Therapyside** uses a chatbot to onboard new clients – subscribers *“speak to a chatbot… that gathers as much information as possible before therapy is initiated”* ([TherapyChat: Using AI to scale and improve accuracy in mental health treatment | CompassList](https://www.compasslist.com/insights/therapychat-using-ai-to-scale-and-improve-accuracy-in-mental-health-treatment#:~:text=Subscribers%20to%20TherapyChat%20speak%20to,other%20clients%20with%20similar%20conditions)). This conversational intake lowers friction and helps match clients with a suitable therapist, contributing to a 97% success rate in first-match assignments ([TherapyChat: Using AI to scale and improve accuracy in mental health treatment | CompassList](https://www.compasslist.com/insights/therapychat-using-ai-to-scale-and-improve-accuracy-in-mental-health-treatment#:~:text=Using%20the%20data%20we%20build,request%20reassignment%20to%20another%20therapist)). Other LatAm platforms like **CuidadosaMENTE** present users with a short compatibility quiz (“**Hacer Test**”) to recommend an ideal therapist, streamlining the selection process for those unsure where to begin. 

From the therapist’s perspective, onboarding processes vary in strictness. Most platforms verify professional credentials (e.g. license numbers, degrees) before allowing therapists onto the marketplace. Terapify publicly notes that they *“select the best psychologists”* for quality, implying a vetting process ([Terapify es una plataforma de terapia psicológica en ... - Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/terapify/p/CITwjWhDzPX/#:~:text=Instagram%20www,la%20calidad%20de%20la)). **RED** plans to take this a step further by requiring credential verification **and a mandatory interview** for every therapist ([Ficha técnica RED (1.7).pdf](file://file-9US1aVyd9pHfswAXWiY5Qn#:~:text=%F0%9F%94%B9%20Terapeutas)), ensuring a high bar of quality and trust. While this adds an extra onboarding step for therapists, it fosters trust with clients from the outset. Therapist onboarding in RED will also capture each provider’s specialties, languages, availability, and capacity (maximum clients they can take) up front ([Casuísticas y emparejamiento.pdf](file://file-2HCxCqjTzrwCrJag5vLKvK#:~:text=2)) ([Casuísticas y emparejamiento.pdf](file://file-2HCxCqjTzrwCrJag5vLKvK#:~:text=3)), so that matching can be precise from day one. 

Overall, competitors strive to reduce user hesitation through friendly, guided sign-up flows. Common best practices include using warm, empathetic language (to reduce stigma), limiting the number of form fields at once, and providing reassurance about privacy and qualifications. RED will mirror these practices – offering a gentle multi-step onboarding for clients (basic info, main concerns, schedule preferences, etc.) and an informative dashboard for new therapists – to minimize drop-off. Notably, **RED introduces a free initial mini-session** (15–30 min) as part of onboarding, so that *clients can meet a therapist risk-free and decide if they wish to continue* ([Casuísticas y emparejamiento.pdf](file://file-2HCxCqjTzrwCrJag5vLKvK#:~:text=3)) ([Casuísticas y emparejamiento.pdf](file://file-2HCxCqjTzrwCrJag5vLKvK#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20El%20cliente%20sabe%20que,para%20conocerse%20con%20el%20terapeuta)). This approach, inspired by UX research that trust builds when users can “have an idea of how the therapist sounds” before committing ([Experience Redefined: 
“A UX Journey to Minimize 
Fear and Friction in Therapy” | by Karthi Durai | Medium](https://creativedesignlifee.medium.com/designing-joy-a-low-friction-therapist-booking-app-a-case-study-4b7f90f33374#:~:text=That%E2%80%99s%20why%20we%20have%20a,also%20builds%20trust%20on%20them)), goes beyond what most current Spanish platforms offer and aims to lower the barrier to starting therapy.

### Matching Logic & Customization  
Platforms differ in how clients are paired with therapists. **Terapify** follows a marketplace model where clients can browse a list of available online psychologists (filtering by specialization or issue) and choose one directly ([Terapia Virtual | Más de 300 Psicólogos Online | Agenda Hoy - Selia Terapia Online](https://selia.co/es/#:~:text=pasos)) ([Terapia Virtual | Más de 300 Psicólogos Online | Agenda Hoy - Selia Terapia Online](https://selia.co/es/#:~:text=Elige%20a%20tu%20especialista%20ideal)). This gives users autonomy but can be daunting for those unfamiliar with therapy – which is why Terapify’s onboarding helps narrow options first. On the other hand, **Therapyside (TherapyChat)** and **Selia** prefer algorithmic matching. Therapyside’s system matches clients to a therapist automatically based on the chatbot’s intake data; it continuously refines its matching algorithm by learning from past outcomes (referencing similar cases to improve future matches) ([TherapyChat: Using AI to scale and improve accuracy in mental health treatment | CompassList](https://www.compasslist.com/insights/therapychat-using-ai-to-scale-and-improve-accuracy-in-mental-health-treatment#:~:text=Subscribers%20to%20TherapyChat%20speak%20to,other%20clients%20with%20similar%20conditions)) ([TherapyChat: Using AI to scale and improve accuracy in mental health treatment | CompassList](https://www.compasslist.com/insights/therapychat-using-ai-to-scale-and-improve-accuracy-in-mental-health-treatment#:~:text=Using%20the%20data%20we%20build,request%20reassignment%20to%20another%20therapist)). Selia offers a hybrid approach: users can manually filter by needs or *“use our matching tools to find your specialist”* ([Terapia Virtual | Más de 300 Psicólogos Online | Agenda Hoy - Selia Terapia Online](https://selia.co/es/#:~:text=Elige%20a%20tu%20especialista%20ideal)), indicating an algorithm will suggest an optimal match. This kind of “smart match” is designed to ensure factors like therapist expertise, language, and availability align with the client’s preferences.

**RED’s initial phase** will use a semi-automated matching process. Upon sign-up, a client fills a questionnaire about their primary concern (e.g. anxiety, depression), preferred therapist attributes (including an option to request a therapist of a specific gender) ([Casuísticas y emparejamiento.pdf](file://file-2HCxCqjTzrwCrJag5vLKvK#:~:text=siempre%20debe%20elegir%20al%20menos,una%20etiqueta%20disponible)), and available time windows. In the MVP, matching may be done manually by an admin who reviews the client’s profile and assigns a fitting therapist ([Ficha técnica RED (1.7).pdf](file://file-9US1aVyd9pHfswAXWiY5Qn#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Se%20registran%20en%20la,con%20su%20disponibilidad%20y%20necesidades)). However, the goal is to rapidly transition to an **automatic matching algorithm (Phase 3)** ([Ficha técnica RED (1.7).pdf](file://file-9US1aVyd9pHfswAXWiY5Qn#:~:text=%F0%9F%94%B9%20FASE%203%20%E2%80%93%20Optimizaci%C3%B3n,y%20Crecimiento)). RED’s planned matching logic (detailed in internal docs) will filter the therapist pool based on required specialties/tags and schedule overlap, then **broadcast the new client to all eligible therapists** in real-time ([Casuísticas y emparejamiento.pdf](file://file-2HCxCqjTzrwCrJag5vLKvK#:~:text=3)). The first therapist to confirm availability “wins” the client assignment ([Casuísticas y emparejamiento.pdf](file://file-2HCxCqjTzrwCrJag5vLKvK#:~:text=3)) ([Casuísticas y emparejamiento.pdf](file://file-2HCxCqjTzrwCrJag5vLKvK#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20A%20cada%20terapeuta%20apto,un%20cliente%20compatible%3B%20%C2%BFte%20interesa%3F%E2%80%9D)) – a fast-response approach similar to how ride-hailing apps match drivers, ensuring minimal wait for the client. Once a therapist accepts, the client is notified *“We’ve found a therapist for you – schedule your first free session”* and can pick a time from that therapist’s calendar ([Casuísticas y emparejamiento.pdf](file://file-2HCxCqjTzrwCrJag5vLKvK#:~:text=4)). If no therapist accepts within a set time, RED will inform the client and offer to place them on a waiting list ([Casuísticas y emparejamiento.pdf](file://file-2HCxCqjTzrwCrJag5vLKvK#:~:text=5)). This contingency handles cases of high demand. Notably, RED’s design avoids overwhelming clients with dozens of profiles; instead it finds a qualified match behind the scenes, while still giving clients the freedom to request a change if the fit isn’t right after the intro session. This balances automation with personal choice.

In terms of customization, most platforms support matching on language (many have bilingual Spanish/English therapists) and therapy focus area. RED will incorporate these as **tags** on therapist profiles for precise filtering ([Casuísticas y emparejamiento.pdf](file://file-2HCxCqjTzrwCrJag5vLKvK#:~:text=2)). One advantage RED aims to have is dynamic matching capacity – therapists can set how many clients they can take and temporarily pause new matches if needed ([Casuísticas y emparejamiento.pdf](file://file-2HCxCqjTzrwCrJag5vLKvK#:~:text=3)) ([Casuísticas y emparejamiento.pdf](file://file-2HCxCqjTzrwCrJag5vLKvK#:~:text=5)). This prevents overloading therapists and ensures quality. Competitors are beginning to adopt similar features (Therapyside allows therapists to mark themselves unavailable to new clients by going “inactive” or “paused”). Overall, RED’s matching strategy is highly structured: initial manual curation for quality, evolving into intelligent automation that considers specialty, availability, and even therapist responsiveness (RED will track how quickly and often therapists accept clients to prioritize those who are most engaged, and issue “strikes” to those who frequently ignore requests) ([Casuísticas y emparejamiento.pdf](file://file-2HCxCqjTzrwCrJag5vLKvK#:~:text=6,responsivos)) ([Casuísticas y emparejamiento.pdf](file://file-2HCxCqjTzrwCrJag5vLKvK#:~:text=,identificar%20y%20abordar%20problemas%20sist%C3%A9micos)). Future versions of RED will explore **AI-driven matching** that can learn from successful long-term client-therapist pairings and factor in more subtle data (e.g. personality compatibility or outcomes) to recommend an even better fit – an approach already hinted at by TherapyChat’s data-driven matching improvements ([TherapyChat: Using AI to scale and improve accuracy in mental health treatment | CompassList](https://www.compasslist.com/insights/therapychat-using-ai-to-scale-and-improve-accuracy-in-mental-health-treatment#:~:text=Subscribers%20to%20TherapyChat%20speak%20to,other%20clients%20with%20similar%20conditions)).

### Design Ergonomics & Accessibility  
Therapy platforms must convey warmth, safety, and professionalism through their design. Common design choices in this sector include **calming color palettes** (often blues or greens for a soothing effect ([Experience Redefined: 
“A UX Journey to Minimize 
Fear and Friction in Therapy” | by Karthi Durai | Medium](https://creativedesignlifee.medium.com/designing-joy-a-low-friction-therapist-booking-app-a-case-study-4b7f90f33374#:~:text=Visual%20Design))), **clean layouts with minimal clutter**, and easy navigation even for non-tech-savvy users. For instance, a UX case study on a therapy app named “Joy” found that using a blue theme and human photographs (rather than abstract graphics) helped make the experience feel more comforting and personal ([Experience Redefined: 
“A UX Journey to Minimize 
Fear and Friction in Therapy” | by Karthi Durai | Medium](https://creativedesignlifee.medium.com/designing-joy-a-low-friction-therapist-booking-app-a-case-study-4b7f90f33374#:~:text=Visual%20Design)). Terapify’s recent UX revamps also prioritized simplicity: they noticed users were dropping off before completing booking/payment, so they introduced a sticky summary and call-to-action button that stays visible, and pre-filled known info to reduce clicks ([Terapify — M.](https://www.milimejia.com/work/terapify#:~:text=,complete%20their%20purchase%20more%20quickly)). The result was a *50% improvement in conversion* after making the interface more straightforward ([Terapify — M.](https://www.milimejia.com/work/terapify#:~:text=Conclusions)). **RED’s UI** will similarly emphasize a frictionless flow – for example, if a user has already entered their contact info during onboarding, it won’t ask again at booking; the next step (scheduling or payment) will be clearly highlighted with a persistent button. 

Accessibility is another critical aspect. While many current platforms focus on core functionality first, few explicitly implement accessibility features from the start. **RED intends to build in accessibility by Phase 3** as a core value ([Ficha técnica RED (1.7).pdf](file://file-9US1aVyd9pHfswAXWiY5Qn#:~:text=%E2%9C%85%20Autenticaci%C3%B3n%20en%20dos%20pasos,2FA)). This means adhering to WCAG guidelines: sufficient color contrast (for visually impaired users), screen-reader friendly labels on all elements, keyboard-navigable forms, and accommodating text size adjustments. Design ergonomics will also consider the **mental state of users seeking therapy** – interfaces should avoid overwhelming visuals or jargon and instead use reassuring microcopy. For example, RED might include a gentle progress indicator during sign-up (so users know it’s just a few easy steps) and comforting messages like “You’re taking a brave step, we’re with you.” Ensuring the platform feels **non-judgmental and inclusive** is key (CuidadosaMENTE explicitly markets their service as an *“espacio libre de juicios”* – a judgment-free space ([Encuentra psicólogos en línea | CuidadosaMENTE](https://cuidadosamente.com/#:~:text=Psic%C3%B3logos%20en%20l%C3%ADnea))). 

Because many users and therapists will access the service via mobile devices, responsive design is imperative. Competitors like Terapify provide mobile apps on iOS/Android to complement their web experience ([Apps de terapia psicológica: ¡Conoce Terapify!](https://www.terapify.com/blog/apps-de-terapia-psicologica/#:~:text=Apps%20de%20terapia%20psicol%C3%B3gica%3A%20%C2%A1Conoce,Store%20en%20cualquier%20dispositivo%20m%C3%B3vil)), and Therapyside’s app is noted for its user-friendly interface and secure video call integration ([Therapyside - Online therapy on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/therapyside-online-therapy/id1223472664#:~:text=Therapyside%20,wherever%20and%20whenever%20you%20want)). RED will prioritize a responsive web app using React, ensuring a seamless experience on smartphones and tablets, and potentially wrap this in a native shell for app store distribution later. Design ergonomics for therapists will be tailored as well – for example, RED’s therapist portal will use clear visual cues (like calendar views and notification badges) to make managing appointments intuitive. In summary, the design ethos is **calm, clear, and accessible**: calm in aesthetics to reduce anxiety, clear in information hierarchy to guide users, and accessible to all users regardless of ability or device.

### Payment & Session Management  
Secure, convenient payment and scheduling are the backbone of online therapy services. Most competitors use a pay-as-you-go model where clients pay for each session (or a bundle of sessions) at the time of booking. Prices in Spain and LATAM are typically set lower than traditional in-person therapy to encourage uptake – for example, TherapyChat’s online sessions range from €34–44, compared to €50–70 for in-person therapy in Spain ([TherapyChat: Using AI to scale and improve accuracy in mental health treatment | CompassList](https://www.compasslist.com/insights/therapychat-using-ai-to-scale-and-improve-accuracy-in-mental-health-treatment#:~:text=Using%20our%20system%20can%20indeed,passed%20through%20to%20the%20client)) ([TherapyChat: Using AI to scale and improve accuracy in mental health treatment | CompassList](https://www.compasslist.com/insights/therapychat-using-ai-to-scale-and-improve-accuracy-in-mental-health-treatment#:~:text=In,on%20how%20many%20you%20buy)). This price reduction is enabled by cutting overhead (therapists use their home/online office) and by platforms taking care of logistics. **Terapify** and peers integrate standard payment gateways (credit/debit cards, often via Stripe or similar) and sometimes offer package discounts. Many allow users to purchase multi-session packs (e.g. 4 or 8 sessions at a slight discount) to encourage ongoing therapy – in Terapify’s checkout redesign, you can see an example where a user selected a package of 4 sessions and the interface clearly shows the total and per-session price ([Terapify — M.](https://www.milimejia.com/work/terapify)). *Providing transparent pricing and an easy checkout flow is crucial:* Terapify discovered that users had trouble completing payments due to too many steps and unclear buttons, which they solved by simplifying the checkout UI ([Terapify — M.](https://www.milimejia.com/work/terapify#:~:text=,complete%20their%20purchase%20more%20quickly)). 

 ([Terapify — M.](https://www.milimejia.com/work/terapify)) *A streamlined payment interface from a competitor (Terapify) guides the user through booking. A clear summary of session details and price is shown alongside a countdown timer for completing payment, reducing uncertainty and encouraging quick action. The design uses a prominent call-to-action and even a short welcome video for reassurance, creating a smooth booking experience.*

**RED’s payment and session management** will leverage these best practices. The platform will use **Stripe for secure payments** ([Ficha técnica RED (1.7).pdf](file://file-9US1aVyd9pHfswAXWiY5Qn#:~:text=%E2%9C%85%20Gesti%C3%B3n%20de%20Citas%20con,integraci%C3%B3n%20de%20calendarios)) ([Ficha técnica RED (1.7).pdf](file://file-9US1aVyd9pHfswAXWiY5Qn#:~:text=%E2%9C%85%20Comisi%C3%B3n%20por%20sesi%C3%B3n%3A%20Entre,seg%C3%BAn%20la%20sostenibilidad%20del%20modelo)), including Stripe Connect to automatically split fees – ensuring therapists receive their portion (70–80%) while RED retains a commission ([Ficha técnica RED (1.7).pdf](file://file-9US1aVyd9pHfswAXWiY5Qn#:~:text=%E2%9C%85%20Implementaci%C3%B3n%20de%20Stripe%20Connect,para%20automatizar%20pagos)). Clients will pay at the point of booking each session (after the free intro chat). RED will support purchasing single sessions or bulk packages ([Ficha técnica RED (1.7).pdf](file://file-9US1aVyd9pHfswAXWiY5Qn#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Pagan%20la%20sesi%C3%B3n%20en,el%20momento%20de%20la%20reserva)); package credits will be tracked in the user’s account to be used for scheduling future sessions with their therapist. Session scheduling in the MVP may be handled through **Calendly integration** ([Ficha técnica RED (1.7).pdf](file://file-9US1aVyd9pHfswAXWiY5Qn#:~:text=%E2%9C%85%20Stripe%20%28pagos%20seguros%29)) – for instance, once a therapist accepts a client, the client could be prompted with the therapist’s Calendly availability to pick a slot. This automates calendar coordination and can even generate video conference links (Calendly can be set to create Zoom/Google Meet links for meetings). In later versions, RED will implement an in-app calendar system for therapists to set availability and for clients to book/reschedule directly within the platform UI.

Handling cancellations and rescheduling is an important part of session management. Most competitors enforce a 24-hour cancellation policy (clients late to cancel are charged, and therapists who cancel late may face penalties). **RED will codify a clear cancellation and no-show policy:** if a client cancels last-minute (within <24h of the session), they forfeit the session credit or payment ([Casuísticas y emparejamiento.pdf](file://file-2HCxCqjTzrwCrJag5vLKvK#:~:text=5)), barring special exceptions. If a therapist has to cancel unexpectedly, RED’s support team would assist in rescheduling or finding a substitute. Both clients and therapists will receive **automated email/SMS reminders** 24 hours and 1 hour before each session ([Casuísticas y emparejamiento.pdf](file://file-2HCxCqjTzrwCrJag5vLKvK#:~:text=5)), a practice proven to reduce no-shows. If a client or therapist can’t attend, RED will offer a hassle-free rescheduling flow – the client can simply pick a new slot (within policy limits) from the therapist’s open times and the system will update both parties’ calendars ([Casuísticas y emparejamiento.pdf](file://file-2HCxCqjTzrwCrJag5vLKvK#:~:text=5)). 

Session management also involves what happens after a session. Many platforms encourage users to book the next session at the end of the current one (some even have the therapist do it in-app with the client’s consent). RED will provide gentle nudges if a client doesn’t schedule another session within a certain timeframe (since consistency is important in therapy). Moreover, RED will maintain a history of sessions, notes, and invoices for users to reference. Using Stripe means the platform can automatically send receipts and handle invoicing for insurance or reimbursement needs ([Ficha técnica RED (1.7).pdf](file://file-9US1aVyd9pHfswAXWiY5Qn#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Resto%20retenido%20por%20la,plataforma)). Importantly, **RED’s payment system will support a scholarship model** – a distinguishing feature aimed at accessibility. Clients who qualify for financial aid can receive sessions at a reduced rate, and the system will apply their scholarship pricing (e.g. first-tier scholarship might price a session at €20) ([Ficha técnica RED (1.7).pdf](file://file-9US1aVyd9pHfswAXWiY5Qn#:~:text=%E2%9C%85%20Sesiones%20est%C3%A1ndar%3A%20Precio%20a%C3%BAn,70)). This is fairly unique; competitors rarely have built-in scholarship programs, although some may offer promo codes or limited pro-bono sessions. By integrating this into payments, RED ensures therapy is not only convenient but also affordable to those in need. 

Finally, all financial data will be handled securely (no credit card info stored on RED servers, only in Stripe vaults) and in compliance with relevant regulations. Session management features like these – easy scheduling, reminders, clear policies, and flexible payment options – contribute to a smoother user experience and build trust in the platform’s reliability.

### Community & Additional Features  
One aspect that sets RED apart is its strong emphasis on community and professional development features beyond one-on-one therapy. Most current platforms in Spanish-speaking markets focus almost exclusively on individual therapy sessions. They might have content resources (blogs, self-help articles, or webinars) but rarely interactive communities. For example, Terapify offers supplemental wellness content and a blog, but no user forums or group chats. **Therapyside** and others have largely concentrated on the core therapist-client interaction, with the founder noting they *“set out wanting to reinvent therapy via chat, but realized we just needed to bring therapy online”* ([TherapyChat: Using AI to scale and improve accuracy in mental health treatment | CompassList](https://www.compasslist.com/insights/therapychat-using-ai-to-scale-and-improve-accuracy-in-mental-health-treatment#:~:text=We%20set%20out%20wanting%20to,needed%20to%20bring%20therapy%20online)) – implying they kept the scope to traditional therapy sessions rather than building social features. 

**RED’s vision, in contrast, includes a broader ecosystem** for both clients and therapists. On the client side, RED plans to introduce **thematic forums and group events in Phase 2** ([Ficha técnica RED (1.7).pdf](file://file-9US1aVyd9pHfswAXWiY5Qn#:~:text=%F0%9F%94%B9%20FASE%202%20%E2%80%93%20Comunidad,y%20Expansi%C3%B3n)). This means clients could anonymously or openly participate in discussion boards about topics like anxiety, grief, or self-improvement, moderated by professionals. Such peer support communities can help users feel less alone and provide value between sessions. Additionally, Phase 4 of RED foresees live workshops and webinars (*“Charlas y eventos en vivo”*) led by therapists or invited experts ([Ficha técnica RED (1.7).pdf](file://file-9US1aVyd9pHfswAXWiY5Qn#:~:text=%F0%9F%94%B9%20FASE%204%20%E2%80%93%20Contenido,Premium%20y%20Monetizaci%C3%B3n)). These could be mindfulness classes, psycho-educational talks, or group therapy sessions. Major US-based platforms (e.g., BetterHelp) have started offering free group webinars to their subscribers; in the Spanish market this is still novel, so RED would be a pioneer in offering **group support options** as part of its platform.

For therapists, RED will foster a **community of practice**. Competitors currently treat therapists primarily as service providers, with little in-platform interaction with each other. RED aims to change that by implementing features like *intervisión* (peer consultation meetings) and *supervisión* (mentorship or case supervision by senior clinicians) for therapists in the network ([Ficha técnica RED (1.7).pdf](file://file-9US1aVyd9pHfswAXWiY5Qn#:~:text=RED%20genera%20oportunidades%20de%20trabajo,pr%C3%A1ctica%20y%20crecimiento%20dentro%20de)) ([Ficha técnica RED (1.7).pdf](file://file-9US1aVyd9pHfswAXWiY5Qn#:~:text=%E2%9C%85%20Para%20los%20terapeutas%3A%20Crear,terapeutas%20con%20supervisi%C3%B3n%20e%20intervisi%C3%B3n)). These sessions, planned in Phase 2, give therapists opportunities to discuss cases (confidentially), share techniques, and support each other, all within RED’s ecosystem. The platform will facilitate scheduling these group meetings and possibly host them via integrated video. Furthermore, RED’s team will organize **exclusive therapist events (1–2 per month)** to build community and loyalty ([Ficha técnica RED (1.7).pdf](file://file-9US1aVyd9pHfswAXWiY5Qn#:~:text=%E2%9C%85%20Eventos%20exclusivos%20para%20terapeutas%2C,mes%2C%20para%20fortalecer%20la%20comunidad)) – e.g. virtual meetups, continuing education workshops, or Q&A sessions with experts. This focus on therapist growth and support is a significant differentiator. It not only helps maintain quality (through ongoing education and ethical supervision) but also serves as a **retention strategy**: therapists will be less inclined to leave the platform or take clients off-platform if they feel they are part of a valued community ([Ficha técnica RED (1.7).pdf](file://file-9US1aVyd9pHfswAXWiY5Qn#:~:text=5)) ([Ficha técnica RED (1.7).pdf](file://file-9US1aVyd9pHfswAXWiY5Qn#:~:text=%E2%9C%85%20Eventos%20exclusivos%20para%20terapeutas%2C,mes%2C%20para%20fortalecer%20la%20comunidad)).

In summary, while platforms like Selia and Terapify are largely transactional (connecting client to therapist for sessions), RED aspires to be a **holistic mental health hub**. By offering forums, group events, and a sense of community, RED addresses dimensions of mental healthcare that go beyond one-on-one therapy. It provides a space for **peer support** among clients and **collaborative growth** among therapists – features currently lacking in most competitors. Of course, these community features must be implemented carefully (with moderation, privacy controls, and opt-in participation) to ensure they enhance the therapeutic experience rather than detract from it. When done right, they can significantly increase user engagement and differentiate RED as not just a service, but a supportive network.

### Automation & Smart Notifications  
Automation is a key driver of efficiency and user engagement in online platforms, and each competitor leverages it to some extent. **TherapyChat** (Therapyside) is a standout in using AI automation: as noted, its chatbot automates the intake interview, and the platform continuously uses data from past sessions to refine its matching algorithm ([TherapyChat: Using AI to scale and improve accuracy in mental health treatment | CompassList](https://www.compasslist.com/insights/therapychat-using-ai-to-scale-and-improve-accuracy-in-mental-health-treatment#:~:text=Subscribers%20to%20TherapyChat%20speak%20to,other%20clients%20with%20similar%20conditions)) ([TherapyChat: Using AI to scale and improve accuracy in mental health treatment | CompassList](https://www.compasslist.com/insights/therapychat-using-ai-to-scale-and-improve-accuracy-in-mental-health-treatment#:~:text=Using%20the%20data%20we%20build,request%20reassignment%20to%20another%20therapist)). This kind of machine learning approach (“reference sessions we’ve done for similar conditions”) has paid off in matching accuracy and is an area RED plans to invest in as well. TherapyChat’s founder even mentioned that *“we’re constantly working to make our matching algorithm better and smarter”* ([TherapyChat: Using AI to scale and improve accuracy in mental health treatment | CompassList](https://www.compasslist.com/insights/therapychat-using-ai-to-scale-and-improve-accuracy-in-mental-health-treatment#:~:text=to%20turn%20out%20to%20be,completely%20different)), highlighting how ongoing data analysis is baked into their operations. Another form of automation on competitors is notification systems. All platforms send basic reminders for upcoming sessions via email or app push notifications, reducing no-shows. Some also send follow-up notifications – for example, if a user doesn’t complete onboarding or abandons a booking, the system might nudge them to continue. **Selia** and others with mobile apps use push notifications to re-engage users (such as “It’s been a week since your last session, ready to talk again?”). This level of smart notification keeps users involved without a human needing to intervene.

**RED will incorporate extensive automation from early on**. In Phase 1, automated email notifications are already in scope for appointment confirmations and reminders ([Ficha técnica RED (1.7).pdf](file://file-9US1aVyd9pHfswAXWiY5Qn#:~:text=%E2%9C%85%20Pagos%20y%20Comisiones%20con,Stripe)). The platform will send out notifications for key events: when a match is found, when a session is booked, reminders 1 day and 1 hour before sessions, and post-session follow-ups (like a brief feedback survey). The matching process itself is highly automated in RED’s design: the system triggers notifications to all appropriate therapists when a new client is searching ([Casuísticas y emparejamiento.pdf](file://file-2HCxCqjTzrwCrJag5vLKvK#:~:text=3)) – this uses automation to speed up response, rather than having an admin manually contact therapists. If no therapist responds in a timely manner, the platform automatically updates the client and manages a waitlist queue ([Casuísticas y emparejamiento.pdf](file://file-2HCxCqjTzrwCrJag5vLKvK#:~:text=5)). On the waitlist, automation will play a role in fairness: RED’s plan includes an *auto-prioritization system* that scores waiting clients by urgency and wait time ([Casuísticas y emparejamiento.pdf](file://file-2HCxCqjTzrwCrJag5vLKvK#:~:text=%E2%97%8F%20Sistema%20de%20priorizaci%C3%B3n)), and periodic updates to those clients about their status ([Casuísticas y emparejamiento.pdf](file://file-2HCxCqjTzrwCrJag5vLKvK#:~:text=%E2%97%8F%20Notificaciones%20autom%C3%A1ticas)). These are smart notifications that keep users informed (“You are 2nd in line, estimated wait 1 week…”) and even require check-ins (asking clients to confirm they still want to stay on the list) to keep the list active ([Casuísticas y emparejamiento.pdf](file://file-2HCxCqjTzrwCrJag5vLKvK#:~:text=necesidades)). Such features ensure no one falls through the cracks silently.

Looking further, RED’s later phases involve **AI and automation enhancements**. In Phase 5, the platform aims to integrate AI for automating certain tasks – for example, generating **session summaries using AI** for therapists ([Ficha técnica RED (1.7).pdf](file://file-9US1aVyd9pHfswAXWiY5Qn#:~:text=%F0%9F%94%B9%20FASE%205%20%E2%80%93%20Inteligencia,Artificial%20y%20Automatizaci%C3%B3n)). This could mean after each session, an AI service (with client consent and data privacy) could transcribe or analyze the session recording/text and produce a draft summary or notes for the therapist, saving them time on paperwork. Another planned use is **AI-driven content moderation** in forums ([Ficha técnica RED (1.7).pdf](file://file-9US1aVyd9pHfswAXWiY5Qn#:~:text=%F0%9F%94%B9%20FASE%205%20%E2%80%93%20Inteligencia,Artificial%20y%20Automatizaci%C3%B3n)): using natural language processing to detect red-flag content (e.g. someone expressing suicidal intent in a forum post) and alerting a human moderator or emergency contact. Competitors currently rely on manual moderation (if they have community content at all), so this will give RED a scalable way to maintain a safe environment. Additionally, machine learning can be applied to the matching algorithm over time. RED can train models on the growing dataset of successful matches, considering outcomes like how long clients stay with a therapist, client feedback ratings, etc., to continuously improve match suggestions (the internal docs mention using ML to optimize matching especially for waitlisted clients in later phases ([Casuísticas y emparejamiento.pdf](file://file-2HCxCqjTzrwCrJag5vLKvK#:~:text=%E2%97%8F%20Emparejamiento%20inteligente%20))). 

Finally, automation in RED will extend to back-office tasks: generating invoices, calculating therapist payouts, sending tax documents, scheduling the intervision meetings, etc., all can be automated to reduce administrative overhead. The **end goal** is a platform that largely “runs itself” so that human effort can be focused on therapy and community, not on logistics. As one competitor’s CEO said, *“we see ourselves as a technology company first and will be building our platform for the next 20 years”* ([TherapyChat: Using AI to scale and improve accuracy in mental health treatment | CompassList](https://www.compasslist.com/insights/therapychat-using-ai-to-scale-and-improve-accuracy-in-mental-health-treatment#:~:text=How%20long%20did%20it%20take,develop%20your%20technology%20and%20platform)) – RED similarly views smart tech and automation not as a one-time feature, but as a continuous improvement process to make therapy more accessible, responsive, and personalized at scale.

## Development Blueprint for RED  

Based on the above analysis and RED’s internal requirements, below is a full development blueprint for implementing the RED platform. This blueprint covers the technology stack, system architecture, matching algorithm, integrations, UX guidelines, and compliance considerations. It is structured as a technical README, providing guidance for engineers and designers working on RED to create a scalable, user-friendly, and secure application.

### 1. Technology Stack Overview  
**Frontend:** RED will use **React.js** for the web client ([Ficha técnica RED (1.7).pdf](file://file-9US1aVyd9pHfswAXWiY5Qn#:~:text=%F0%9F%94%B9%20Frontend%20)). React offers a component-based architecture, a rich ecosystem of libraries, and excellent performance for dynamic UIs. It allows us to build a responsive web app and potentially reuse components for a future React Native mobile app. We will utilize modern React features (hooks, context API) and possibly a framework like **Next.js** if server-side rendering or SEO for public pages is needed (though the app is primarily behind login). Styling can be handled with a component library that ensures consistency and accessibility – e.g. **Material-UI (MUI)** or **Chakra UI**, which provide ready-made accessible components (buttons, forms, modals) that align with our design system. For state management, lightweight solutions like the Context API or **Redux Toolkit** can be used where global state is needed (e.g. user auth status, current chat), though we will aim to keep state localized to components as much as possible for simplicity. 

**Backend:** The backend will be built with **Node.js and Express** ([Ficha técnica RED (1.7).pdf](file://file-9US1aVyd9pHfswAXWiY5Qn#:~:text=%F0%9F%94%B9%20Backend%20,debe%20ser%20escalable%20y%20traspasable)). Node.js is chosen for its scalability (especially for real-time features) and the wide pool of JavaScript talent that can work across front and back end. Express is a minimalist web framework that will allow us to create a RESTful API to serve the React frontend and mobile clients. We may structure the backend as a set of microservices in the future, but initially a monolithic REST API is sufficient for an MVP. The tech stack is “JavaScript all the way down,” simplifying development since both client and server use the same language. We’ll use Node’s asynchronous, event-driven model to easily integrate real-time notifications and chats. 

**Database:** RED will use a **PostgreSQL** relational database ([Ficha técnica RED (1.7).pdf](file://file-9US1aVyd9pHfswAXWiY5Qn#:~:text=%E2%9C%85%20Node)). Postgres is reliable, ACID-compliant, and well-suited for structured data and complex queries (we will need to join data between users, therapists, sessions, etc. efficiently). It also supports JSON columns, which could be useful for storing semi-structured data like therapist availability slots or user preference tags, if needed. Using a relational DB ensures data integrity for things like payments and scheduling. We will design a clear schema (see next section) with proper indexing on fields used for searching (e.g. therapist specialties, availability times). An ORM such as **Prisma** or **Sequelize** will be used to interface with Postgres in code, which will speed up development and reduce SQL boilerplate. Prisma in particular can work nicely with TypeScript (which we plan to use for the backend for better type safety). 

**Hosting & DevOps:** The app will be containerized with Docker for consistency across development and production. For hosting, we’ll choose a scalable cloud platform like **AWS** or **Google Cloud** ([Ficha técnica RED (1.7).pdf](file://file-9US1aVyd9pHfswAXWiY5Qn#:~:text=%F0%9F%94%B9%20Hosting%20y%20Escalabilidad%20,debe%20ser%20escalable%20y%20traspasable)). In AWS, for example, we could use EC2 or Elastic Beanstalk for the Node server, RDS for PostgreSQL, and S3 for storing any user-uploaded files (though initially we won’t have many file uploads aside from possible profile pictures). We will also consider using AWS Amplify or Vercel for deploying the frontend, and set up CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment on merges to main. Scalability is a priority – as RED grows, we may move to container orchestration (Kubernetes or AWS ECS) to handle multiple instances of the Node server behind a load balancer. Using cloud infrastructure also makes it easier to comply with data residency requirements (we can host in EU regions to satisfy GDPR). 

**Key Libraries and Tools:**  
- *Authentication:* We’ll implement secure authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for API auth. Libraries like **Passport.js** (with a JWT strategy) or **NextAuth** (if Next.js is used) can manage login flows. Passwords will be hashed (using bcrypt or Argon2). In future, OAuth integration for enterprise logins or social logins could be added, but initially a simple email/password signup with email verification is enough ([Casuísticas y emparejamiento.pdf](file://file-2HCxCqjTzrwCrJag5vLKvK#:~:text=1)).  
- *Real-time Communication:* For live chat and instant notifications, we have a couple of options. We can use **Firebase Realtime Database or Firestore** for a quick setup of realtime chat (the internal spec suggested Firebase as an option) ([Ficha técnica RED (1.7).pdf](file://file-9US1aVyd9pHfswAXWiY5Qn#:~:text=%E2%9C%85%20Stripe%20%28pagos%20seguros%29)). Alternatively, we can integrate **WebSockets** on the Node server using **Socket.io** to push real-time messages and alerts to clients (this gives us full control and on-premise data handling). Another route is **Twilio Programmable Chat** or **Twilio Conversations API**, which offloads the complexity of real-time messaging to a third-party service and provides SDKs for web and mobile (Twilio was also mentioned as an integration option) ([Ficha técnica RED (1.7).pdf](file://file-9US1aVyd9pHfswAXWiY5Qn#:~:text=%E2%9C%85%20Stripe%20%28pagos%20seguros%29)). We’ll weigh these options; a custom Socket.io might be more flexible for custom features (and avoids vendor lock-in), whereas Firebase/Twilio can accelerate development of the MVP.  
- *Forms & Validation:* The React app will have various forms (registration, questionnaires, scheduling). We’ll use a form library like **Formik** or **React Hook Form** to manage form state and validation smoothly. This will help enforce required fields, proper formatting (e.g. email, date inputs), and show helpful error messages to users, which is critical for a smooth onboarding UX.  
- *Payments:* **Stripe SDK** will be used on the frontend for handling card inputs (Stripe Elements) in a secure manner. On the backend, we’ll use the Stripe Node library to create checkout sessions, handle webhooks for payment success/failure, and manage payouts to therapists via Stripe Connect accounts ([Ficha técnica RED (1.7).pdf](file://file-9US1aVyd9pHfswAXWiY5Qn#:~:text=%E2%9C%85%20Implementaci%C3%B3n%20de%20Stripe%20Connect,para%20automatizar%20pagos)).  
- *Email & Notifications:* For emails, we can use **SendGrid** (which integrates well with Node, and is actually owned by Twilio) or AWS SES to send verification emails, reminders, etc. For push notifications to the mobile app (in the future) or web push, we might use **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)**. In the interim, email and in-app notifications will suffice.  
- *Video Calls:* While not explicitly mandated in the internal docs, video call capability is implied (as therapy sessions will be by video). We can integrate with third-party video solutions. One easy approach is generating **Zoom** meeting links via Zoom’s API and embedding the Zoom client or launching it externally for sessions. Another approach is using **Twilio Video** or **Daily.co** to embed a video chat widget in our app for a more seamless experience. For MVP, we might rely on external (e.g. the therapist and client agree on a Zoom link via Calendly), but long-term, a built-in video conferencing using WebRTC (via Twilio or an open-source library like Jitsi Meet) will improve UX.  

**Summary:** This stack (React + Node/Express + Postgres, powered by Stripe/Twilio/Calendly services) is chosen for **speed of development**, **scalability**, and a **smooth developer experience**. It aligns with RED’s needs by supporting real-time features (chat, notifications), handling secure payments, and providing a robust foundation that can grow (horizontal scaling of stateless Node servers, read replicas for Postgres as needed, etc.). Using popular frameworks and services also means we can find community support and hire developers with relevant experience easily. 

### 2. Database Architecture & Schema Design  
Designing the database schema for RED requires capturing users (clients and therapists), their relationships, scheduling data, messaging, and community content. Below is a high-level overview of the core entities and their schemas:

- **Users Table**: This will store common attributes for all users (both clients and therapists, and even admins). Fields: `user_id (PK)`, `name`, `email`, `password_hash`, `role` (e.g. “client”, “therapist”, “admin”), `created_at`, `last_login`, etc. We separate roles because authentication is similar for all, but certain fields apply only to therapists vs clients. We may use a single table with role or separate tables joined by a common user ID. A single table approach simplifies login (one place to check credentials) but we will likely have a separate **Therapists Profile** table for therapist-specific data (to avoid cluttering the user record).

- **Therapists Profile Table**: Fields: `therapist_id (PK, FK to user_id)`, `license_number`, `verified (boolean)`, `bio`, `profile_photo_url`, `years_experience`, `languages` (could be a text array or a join to a languages table), `specialties` (join table or text array of tags like “anxiety, depression”), `status` (“active”, “paused”, “inactive”) ([Casuísticas y emparejamiento.pdf](file://file-2HCxCqjTzrwCrJag5vLKvK#:~:text=5)), `max_clients_capacity` (integer) ([Casuísticas y emparejamiento.pdf](file://file-2HCxCqjTzrwCrJag5vLKvK#:~:text=3)), and `current_client_count`. We will also store availability, possibly in a related table or JSON: e.g. **Therapist_Availability** table with `therapist_id`, `weekday`, `start_time`, `end_time` to represent their regular slots. Alternatively, we integrate Calendly and not store detailed availability ourselves for MVP. If using our own scheduler later, we’ll store available time slots or use a pattern (like weekly schedule plus exceptions). A **Therapist_Specialty** join table can link therapists to multiple specialty tags (like “anxiety”, “couples”, etc.) for flexible querying. 

- **Clients Profile Table**: Fields: `client_id (PK, FK to user_id)`, `date_of_birth` (optional, if needed for assigning or just record), `preferred_language`, `preferred_therapist_gender` (enum or boolean), and any assessment info from onboarding (e.g. `primary_concern` tag) ([Casuísticas y emparejamiento.pdf](file://file-2HCxCqjTzrwCrJag5vLKvK#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Checklist%20de%20%E2%80%9Craz%C3%B3n%20principal,idioma%20deseado%2C%20horarios%20aproximados)). We will keep this minimal; sensitive details about their issues can be discussed with the therapist rather than stored. We may have a field like `assigned_therapist_id` to quickly reference their current therapist (once matched), though this could also be derived from the latest active Session or a separate Relationship table.

- **Therapist-Client Relationship / Assignment**: We might have a table to track the pairing once a client is matched to a therapist. For instance **Therapy_Assignment**: `client_id`, `therapist_id`, `assigned_on`, `is_active (boolean)`. This would represent an ongoing therapeutic relationship. If a client switches therapist or leaves, we update/close the old assignment and create a new one for the new therapist. This table can also track status of the first free session (e.g. `had_intro_session (boolean)` and `continued_with_therapist (boolean)` to know if they stayed). It’s also helpful for reporting how many clients each therapist has.

- **Sessions Table**: This holds scheduled therapy sessions (past and future). Fields: `session_id (PK)`, `client_id (FK)`, `therapist_id (FK)`, `start_datetime`, `end_datetime` (or a duration field if we assume fixed length like 50 minutes), `status` (“scheduled”, “completed”, “canceled”, “no_show”), `is_intro` (boolean, true for the free first session) ([Casuísticas y emparejamiento.pdf](file://file-2HCxCqjTzrwCrJag5vLKvK#:~:text=3)), `booking_time` (timestamp of when it was booked), `canceled_time` (if applicable), `canceled_by` (client/therapist). We also include a `video_link` field if we pre-generate a meeting URL, or otherwise instructions for how to join. After a session, therapists might write brief notes – we won’t store detailed psychotherapy notes in this table for privacy, but perhaps allow a short `summary_note` that only the therapist can see (if at all). Payment status can be inferred (intro sessions free, others paid at booking), but we might include a `payment_status` or link to a Payment record.

- **Payments Table**: Records of transactions. Fields: `payment_id (PK)`, `client_id`, `therapist_id`, `session_id` (nullable if payment is for a package rather than a single session), `amount`, `currency`, `payment_method` (or token), `stripe_charge_id` (to cross-reference in Stripe), `status` (“paid”, “refunded”, etc.), `timestamp`. For package purchases, we might have `package_id` instead of session. We will support partial refunds (e.g. if a session is canceled for a valid reason, maybe a 50% refund) ([Casuísticas y emparejamiento.pdf](file://file-2HCxCqjTzrwCrJag5vLKvK#:~:text=5)) – those will be recorded as separate entries or as adjustments.

- **Packages Table** (if supporting bundles): Fields: `package_id`, `client_id`, `therapist_id`, `num_sessions`, `sessions_used`, `purchased_on`, `expires_on` (if we impose an expiry). When a client with a package books a session with that therapist, it deducts from sessions_used and no new payment is charged. This ties a client to one therapist; if they switch therapists, packages might not carry over (or we could allow transfers on a case-by-case basis via admin).

- **Waitlist Table**: In case of no immediate match, we record interested clients. Fields: `waitlist_id`, `client_id`, `requested_on`, `status` (“waiting”, “matched”, “removed”), `priority_score`. The system will update this when a therapist becomes available or when the client is matched. This helps implement the waiting list logic and priority scoring (factors like urgency, time waiting) ([Casuísticas y emparejamiento.pdf](file://file-2HCxCqjTzrwCrJag5vLKvK#:~:text=%E2%97%8F%20Sistema%20de%20priorizaci%C3%B3n)) ([Casuísticas y emparejamiento.pdf](file://file-2HCxCqjTzrwCrJag5vLKvK#:~:text=%E2%97%8F%20Emparejamiento%20inteligente%20)).

- **Messages (Chat) Tables**: We’ll implement a messaging system for client-therapist communication after the first session. We can design it with a **Conversation** table and a **Message** table. Conversation could have `conversation_id`, `client_id`, `therapist_id` (essentially one conversation thread per therapy pair), and maybe `started_on`. The **Message** table: `message_id`, `conversation_id`, `sender_id` (could be client or therapist user id), `content` (text body or file link), `timestamp`. If using a third-party chat (Firebase, etc.), we might not need our own tables initially, but having them is good for audit trails and potential future migration. We’ll enforce that chat only becomes active when appropriate: after the intro session and if the client continues ([Casuísticas y emparejamiento.pdf](file://file-2HCxCqjTzrwCrJag5vLKvK#:~:text=6,Secci%C3%B3n%207)) ([Casuísticas y emparejamiento.pdf](file://file-2HCxCqjTzrwCrJag5vLKvK#:~:text=1)). Prior to that, any attempt to message will be disabled (to ensure all initial communication goes through the scheduled session). We should also consider a simple **notification** table or use a real-time channel to notify the recipient of new messages if they are offline (though this can also be done through Firebase push or email).

- **Forum & Community Tables** (Phase 2+): For forums, we’d create something like **Forum_Post**: `post_id`, `author_user_id`, `category` (e.g. “Anxiety” forum), `title`, `body`, `created_at`. And **Forum_Reply**: `reply_id`, `post_id`, `author_user_id`, `body`, `created_at`, `parent_reply_id` (for threaded replies). We would also have moderation fields like `is_flagged` or `is_closed`. The structure is similar to a typical message board. We might also have **Events Table** for workshops: `event_id`, `title`, `description`, `scheduled_time`, `host_user_id` (therapist or admin hosting), `capacity_limit`, `meeting_link`. And an **Event_Registration** table linking users to events they signed up for. These allow community interactions at scale. These tables won’t be heavily used in MVP but should be in the schema planning for future expansion.

- **Scholarship & Billing Adjustments**: A **Scholarship** table might track which clients have discounted rates. Fields: `scholarship_id`, `client_id`, `tier` (e.g. 1st tier = 20€/session, 2nd tier = 35€/session as per the doc) ([Ficha técnica RED (1.7).pdf](file://file-9US1aVyd9pHfswAXWiY5Qn#:~:text=%E2%9C%85%20Sesiones%20est%C3%A1ndar%3A%20Precio%20a%C3%BAn,70)), `start_date`, `end_date` (scholarship lasts e.g. 6 months) ([Ficha técnica RED (1.7).pdf](file://file-9US1aVyd9pHfswAXWiY5Qn#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Primera%20beca%3A%20precio%20por,35)). The pricing logic in the app then checks if a client has an active scholarship entry and applies the appropriate discount to session prices. We’ll also include an **AdminSettings** or config table for things like cancellation policy timings (e.g. 24h) and commission rates, so they’re not hard-coded.

- **Audit & Logs**: Not a specific table, but we will log critical actions (e.g. therapist accepts a match, client requests a change, payments) either in separate log tables or using a logging service, to have an audit trail especially for disputes or analyzing system performance (e.g. average therapist response time, etc. ([Casuísticas y emparejamiento.pdf](file://file-2HCxCqjTzrwCrJag5vLKvK#:~:text=,identificar%20y%20abordar%20problemas%20sist%C3%A9micos))).

**Relationships & Indices:** We will establish foreign key relationships with cascade rules where appropriate (e.g. if a user is deleted – though normally we’d rarely delete, more likely deactivate – their related sessions or messages might be archived or reassigned). Key indices include: index on `Therapists (status, specialties)` for matching queries, index on `Sessions (therapist_id, start_datetime)` and `(client_id, start_datetime)` for quickly finding upcoming sessions, index on `Messages (conversation_id, timestamp)` for chat retrieval, etc. We might also use full-text search for forum content if needed.

This schema allows us to enforce platform rules too. For example, by linking sessions to payments, we can verify that every completed session had a payment (or was free intro). By having a relationship table or status, we know not to match a client who is already in an active therapy with someone else unless they request a change. The **design favors relational integrity and easy querying** – e.g., an admin dashboard can join Users, Sessions, Payments to see who hasn’t paid or which therapists have many no-shows.

We will also consider data partitioning in the future if volume grows (e.g. separate tables or schemas per region, or archiving old messages to a cheaper storage if needed). But initially, with a few thousand users and sessions, a single Postgres database with the above schema is more than sufficient.

### 3. Smart Matching Algorithm Logic  
RED’s matching algorithm is the heart of connecting clients with the right therapist. The logic will evolve in stages:

**Phase 1 – Manual & Rules-Based Matching:** In the MVP, matching is manual but follows a defined rule set. An administrator will review new client intakes (the questionnaire results) and then search the therapist database for matches by filtering specialization, language, and available time windows that overlap with the client’s schedule. Essentially, the admin is mimicking what our eventual algorithm will do. The admin will then assign the client to a chosen therapist. This process will be logged in the system (creating a Therapy_Assignment record and notifying both parties). Even in this phase, some automation assists the admin: for example, the admin interface can have a “Find Matches” button that runs a query to list top therapist candidates for that client, sorted perhaps by number of matching criteria.

**Phase 2 – Automatic Broadcast Matching:** Once we have enough supply of therapists, we will remove the admin middleman for standard cases. As described earlier, the system will automatically execute the following steps when a client is looking for a therapist: 

1. **Trigger Match Search:** When a new client registers and completes the intake form (or an existing client requests to change therapist), an event is fired in the backend to initiate matching ([Casuísticas y emparejamiento.pdf](file://file-2HCxCqjTzrwCrJag5vLKvK#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Se%20activa%20cuando%20un,2)). This could be implemented as a function that pulls all relevant data (client’s tags, preferences, availability). 

2. **Filter Therapist Pool:** The algorithm filters all therapists who are `Active` (available for new clients) and who meet the criteria:
   - They have all the required specialty tags the client indicated (or at least the main issue tag) ([Casuísticas y emparejamiento.pdf](file://file-2HCxCqjTzrwCrJag5vLKvK#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Se%20buscan%20todos%20los,terapeutas%20que%20cumplan)).
   - They speak the client’s preferred language.
   - They have capacity (< max_clients) ([Casuísticas y emparejamiento.pdf](file://file-2HCxCqjTzrwCrJag5vLKvK#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Etiquetas%20,con%20las%20del%20cliente)).
   - They have some overlap in available hours with the client’s indicated free times (this might be coarse initially – e.g. if client can do evenings, we filter to therapists who offer evening slots).
   - Optionally, match gender preference (if client requested a female therapist, filter to female therapists).
   This yields a list of eligible therapists.

3. **Notify Eligible Therapists:** The system will send out a notification (likely email and/or push notification via the therapist app) to each therapist in that list simultaneously: e.g. “New client looking for therapy in [general area of need]. Click to accept if you can take this client.” ([Casuísticas y emparejamiento.pdf](file://file-2HCxCqjTzrwCrJag5vLKvK#:~:text=3)). The notification will not reveal personal details, just enough info for the therapist to decide (we could include the client’s first name, age range, main concern, and requested session times). We will implement this via an async job/queue to fan-out notifications quickly.

4. **First Acceptance Wins:** Whichever therapist clicks “Accept” first is assigned the client ([Casuísticas y emparejamiento.pdf](file://file-2HCxCqjTzrwCrJag5vLKvK#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20A%20cada%20terapeuta%20apto,un%20cliente%20compatible%3B%20%C2%BFte%20interesa%3F%E2%80%9D)). The backend will record this acceptance and immediately mark the client as matched, rejecting any later attempts by other therapists (we’ll need to handle the race condition by, for example, updating a status in a transaction such that only the first update succeeds). Once assigned, we create the official therapy relationship record and send confirmation notifications to both sides.

5. **Client Scheduling:** After a match, the client is prompted to schedule their first free session with that therapist ([Casuísticas y emparejamiento.pdf](file://file-2HCxCqjTzrwCrJag5vLKvK#:~:text=4)). The system will present the therapist’s available slots (via Calendly embed or our calendar) so the client can pick one. Upon scheduling, confirmation goes out and the process moves to the session phase.

6. **No Response Handling:** If no therapist accepts the match request within X hours (let’s say 24 hours to be safe in early days), the system will notify the client that no one is immediately available ([Casuísticas y emparejamiento.pdf](file://file-2HCxCqjTzrwCrJag5vLKvK#:~:text=5)). The client is offered to either broaden criteria or join the waitlist. Joining the waitlist means we create a Waitlist entry. The system will periodically (or upon any therapist status change) retry the matching for waitlisted clients. We might also escalate the notification to admins to manually intervene if a client is waiting too long or has very specific criteria.

This broadcast approach ensures a fast turnaround and also respects therapists’ autonomy (they opt-in to a client rather than being force-assigned). It’s worth noting this approach is different from TherapyChat’s internal algorithm that pre-selects one best therapist for the client. We choose broadcast to distribute opportunities and account for therapist real-time availability and willingness. Over time, if we find this doesn’t scale (say, 100 therapists all getting pings frequently could be chaotic), we might refine it to a rotating system or a top-N invite rather than blast-all. But initially, when therapist pool is moderate, this is effective.

**Matching Customizations:** RED’s algorithm accounts for customization like therapist gender, client issue type, and language preferences as described. In future enhancements, we can also consider *personality matching* – e.g., some clients might prefer an older therapist, or a certain therapeutic approach (CBT vs psychoanalytic). We could incorporate those into the filtering (therapist profiles may include therapy approach, which could be another matching criterion if the client has a preference). For now, the focus is on availability and specialty as the primary match factors.

**Machine Learning Enhancements (Phase 4/5):** As data accumulates, we plan to introduce an AI-driven matching score. Instead of first-come-first-served acceptance, an alternative is to rank therapists by a “fit score” and invite the top match first (giving them say 1 hour to accept, then moving to the next). A *fit score algorithm* could be trained on historical data: factors like the therapist’s success with similar clients (did clients with anxiety stick with this therapist for many sessions?), the therapist’s response time (more responsive therapists get priority) ([Casuísticas y emparejamiento.pdf](file://file-2HCxCqjTzrwCrJag5vLKvK#:~:text=,identificar%20y%20abordar%20problemas%20sist%C3%A9micos)), and even client feedback ratings after initial sessions. Research shows that matching on certain factors can improve outcomes, so an ML model could learn those patterns ([How Meela Raised €2.6M with Matching Algorithms | ZenDev](https://www.zendev.se/industries/healthcare/matching-algorithms#:~:text=How%20Meela%20Raised%20%E2%82%AC2,find%20the%20right%20therapist%20fit)). For example, perhaps younger clients engage longer with younger therapists – the model might pick up on such correlations and subtly influence match suggestions. We can start by collecting data (feedback after first session, whether the client requested a switch later, etc.) and then experiment with a recommendation system. This would be a proprietary asset for RED and a competitive differentiator, as a co-founder of a similar platform noted: *“Matching algorithms provide a strong workaround by analyzing client profiles, preferences and feedback to help find the right therapist fit.”* ([How Meela Raised €2.6M with Matching Algorithms | ZenDev](https://www.zendev.se/industries/healthcare/matching-algorithms#:~:text=How%20Meela%20Raised%20%E2%82%AC2,find%20the%20right%20therapist%20fit)).

**Re-Matching and Therapist Change:** The algorithm must also handle when a client wants to switch therapists after some time. In RED, if a client or therapist ends the engagement, the client goes back into “matching needed” state. The system will exclude the previous therapist from new matches for that client ([Casuísticas y emparejamiento.pdf](file://file-2HCxCqjTzrwCrJag5vLKvK#:~:text=5,quien%20se%20cerr%C3%B3%20el%20proceso)) to respect the client’s decision. The matching process then repeats as if the client is new, possibly with updated preferences. We also limit how frequently a client can request changes (e.g. maximum 3 switches in a certain period) to prevent abuse or “shopping around” endlessly ([Casuísticas y emparejamiento.pdf](file://file-2HCxCqjTzrwCrJag5vLKvK#:~:text=4,terapeuta)). This kind of rule can be enforced in the logic that triggers a new match (check how many prior therapists the client has had recently).

**Edge Cases & Special Logic:**  
- **Overload:** If we have far more clients than therapists (supply-demand imbalance), the algorithm might place many in waitlist. We have strategies for this: e.g. temporarily show a message on sign-up “Therapist availability is currently limited – you may experience a delay” to set expectations ([Casuísticas y emparejamiento.pdf](file://file-2HCxCqjTzrwCrJag5vLKvK#:~:text=1)). Also, we could implement an **overflow mechanism** like group sessions or self-help content for those waiting ([Casuísticas y emparejamiento.pdf](file://file-2HCxCqjTzrwCrJag5vLKvK#:~:text=%E2%97%8F%20Opciones%20alternativas%20%28fase%202)). The algorithm could detect if waitlist length > X and automatically email those users with resources (articles, coping exercises) as a stop-gap.
- **Therapist Unresponsiveness:** If a therapist consistently ignores match requests, our system will flag them. As per the plan, a strike system will auto-mark therapists who don’t respond 3 times ([Casuísticas y emparejamiento.pdf](file://file-2HCxCqjTzrwCrJag5vLKvK#:~:text=6,responsivos)). After certain strikes, we might set their status to “paused” automatically or lower their priority in the algorithm ([Casuísticas y emparejamiento.pdf](file://file-2HCxCqjTzrwCrJag5vLKvK#:~:text=%E2%97%8F%20Implementar%20un%20sistema%20de,terapeutas%20que%20frecuentemente%20no%20responden)) ([Casuísticas y emparejamiento.pdf](file://file-2HCxCqjTzrwCrJag5vLKvK#:~:text=,identificar%20y%20abordar%20problemas%20sist%C3%A9micos)). Conversely, highly responsive therapists get more matches – essentially an internal reputation score.
- **Emergency Situations:** If a client indicates something that suggests a crisis (e.g. suicidal ideation), we might bypass the usual queue and immediately flag an admin or on-call crisis therapist. An “emergency” button will also be available for clients in the app that provides local crisis hotline info ([Casuísticas y emparejamiento.pdf](file://file-2HCxCqjTzrwCrJag5vLKvK#:~:text=6)), as automation cannot fully handle such cases alone.

In summary, RED’s matching logic starts with a straightforward rules-based approach (ensuring each match meets the basic requirements) and will evolve into a **smart, learning system**. We will continuously monitor metrics like match acceptance time, first-session success (whether the client continues), and satisfaction to refine the algorithm. The design goal is to maximize the likelihood that a client finds a compatible therapist on the first try, minimizing the need for switches (TherapyChat achieved a 97% success in first matches largely through algorithmic refinement ([TherapyChat: Using AI to scale and improve accuracy in mental health treatment | CompassList](https://www.compasslist.com/insights/therapychat-using-ai-to-scale-and-improve-accuracy-in-mental-health-treatment#:~:text=Using%20the%20data%20we%20build,request%20reassignment%20to%20another%20therapist)), which we aim to replicate). Additionally, by automating the mechanics of matching and providing timely notifications, we keep the process quick – ideally a client signs up and gets a confirmed therapist and session time within 24–48 hours or less, which would outpace many competitors.

### 4. Key Integrations & APIs  
Building RED will involve integrating several third-party services to handle critical functionalities securely and efficiently. Here are the key integrations and how they fit into the system:

- **Stripe for Payments:** We will integrate Stripe both on the client side and server side. On the frontend, we’ll use **Stripe Elements** to collect card details in a secure, PCI-compliant way (so that raw card data never touches our servers). On the backend, we’ll use **Stripe Connect** with a Standard or Express account model for therapists ([Ficha técnica RED (1.7).pdf](file://file-9US1aVyd9pHfswAXWiY5Qn#:~:text=%E2%9C%85%20Implementaci%C3%B3n%20de%20Stripe%20Connect,para%20automatizar%20pagos)). Each therapist will onboard to Stripe (entering their banking info, etc.) – Stripe provides a hosted onboarding we can redirect them to. Once set up, when a client makes a payment, the backend will create a PaymentIntent or Checkout Session specifying the charge split (e.g. 75% to therapist’s connected account, 25% to our platform account). Stripe will automatically route payouts to the therapist (we can configure payout schedule – immediate or daily). We’ll also set up webhook endpoints to listen for events like `payment_intent.succeeded` or `charge.refunded` to update our database payment status. Recurring billing isn’t needed since we’re pay-per-session, but if we introduce subscription plans for e.g. unlimited corporate packages, Stripe can handle that too. Using Stripe greatly reduces our burden in complying with payment security (PCI) and building robust billing flows. 

- **Calendly / Calendar Integration:** In MVP, we plan to use Calendly to schedule sessions ([Ficha técnica RED (1.7).pdf](file://file-9US1aVyd9pHfswAXWiY5Qn#:~:text=%E2%9C%85%20Stripe%20%28pagos%20seguros%29)). Therapists would set up their availability on Calendly (we’ll ask them to integrate their Google Calendar via Calendly to avoid double-booking). For each therapist, we can maintain a Calendly link (possibly a hidden event type for RED sessions). When a client needs to book, we either redirect to a scheduling page or embed Calendly’s widget in our app. Calendly can send confirmation emails and calendar invites automatically. In the backend, we can use Calendly’s API or webhooks to know when a session is booked (so we can create the Session record in our DB). If we decide not to use Calendly, an alternative is the **Google Calendar API** directly – connecting each therapist’s Google Calendar to read free/busy times. That requires a lot more OAuth handling and complexity, so Calendly is a good intermediary. In Phase 3, if we implement our own calendar UI, we might phase Calendly out, but we can still use Cronofy or Google API to integrate calendars. For now, Calendly provides a quick scheduling solution and even handles sending the meeting link (it can be configured to use Zoom integration – each scheduled meeting would generate a unique Zoom link which is included in the invite). This saves us from building video integration for MVP. 

- **Twilio for Communications:** Twilio offers multiple services that align with RED’s needs:
  - *SMS/WhatsApp Notifications:* We can use **Twilio SMS API** to send text reminders to clients/therapists who opt in for SMS notifications (in addition to email). For example, an hour before the session, an SMS “Reminder: You have a session at 5pm with [Therapist Name] – join link: [URL]”. Twilio’s WhatsApp API could even be used to send WhatsApp notifications for users in regions where WhatsApp is preferred. This adds convenience and can be automated via their API triggered from our backend scheduler.
  - *Chat and Voice/Video:* Twilio has a **Programmable Chat** service and **Twilio Video**. If we want to embed chat in the app without building from scratch, Twilio Chat provides SDKs to manage chat rooms (conversations) and messages with real-time updates. However, since chat is quite central, we might implement it ourselves or via Firebase. Twilio Video could be used to implement in-browser video sessions – it provides HIPAA-compliant, encrypted video rooms. We could create a video room on the fly for a session and generate a join token for client and therapist. This would remove dependency on external apps like Zoom and keep users in RED’s interface. The downside is development effort and cost (Twilio Video has usage fees). For the medium term, we may rely on Zoom/Meet for simplicity, and revisit Twilio Video when we want a branded experience.
  - *Phone Masking/Calls:* If we ever allow phone call sessions or need to mask personal numbers, Twilio Voice could connect calls without revealing phone numbers. Not in scope initially, but Twilio would be the go-to.
  
  Since Twilio and Stripe are both mentioned, we might take advantage of the fact that Twilio owns SendGrid (for emails) and has a broad range of communications APIs, potentially simplifying vendor management.

- **Firebase (Alternative to some Twilio features):** Firebase could be our choice for real-time chat and push notifications. Using **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)**, we can send push notifications to the React app (if users allow) and to future mobile apps – e.g. for new message alerts or general announcements. **Firebase Realtime Database** or **Cloud Firestore** can be used to store chat messages and get instant sync. This is developer-friendly and scales automatically. The tradeoff is data is stored in Google’s servers (we’d have to ensure GDPR compliance by using European data centers). If we want more control and to store messages in our Postgres, we might still use WebSockets. We could also use Firebase as a quick solution for the forum feature initially, but likely not necessary.

- **Email Service (SendGrid/Mailchimp SES etc.):** We will integrate an email service to send various system emails: account verification, password reset, session reminders, newsletter/announcements, etc. **SendGrid** is a reliable choice and offers up to 100 free emails/day which is enough in early stage. We’ll set up verified sender domains and templates (for consistent branding in emails). Another option is **Mailchimp Mandrill** or **AWS SES**; any can work, but SendGrid’s Node library and documentation are straightforward. We will also ensure emails are localized (initially Spanish content, possibly English too if needed).

- **Analytics & Error Tracking:** Though not user-facing, integrating **Google Analytics** or a privacy-friendly alternative (to track usage funnels, drop-off in onboarding) will help us refine UX. Also, an error monitoring service like **Sentry** will be integrated into both the React app and Node backend so we get alerts on any runtime errors or crashes, helping maintain a robust service.

- **GDPR Compliance Tools:** We might integrate a cookie consent banner using a library, and potentially a service like **OneTrust** for managing user data consents if needed for analytics cookies, etc. This ensures we inform users of data practices and allow opt-outs where required.

All these integrations will have their associated API keys and secrets, which we will store securely (in environment variables or a secrets manager). As part of setup, we’ll also ensure proper testing in sandbox modes (Stripe has test mode, Twilio has trial accounts) before going live.

By leveraging these third-party services, RED can deliver a rich feature set without reinventing the wheel for payments, scheduling, or communications. Each integration will be encapsulated (e.g., a PaymentService module for Stripe, a NotificationService for Twilio/SendGrid) to keep our code organized. The blueprint from the internal doc explicitly calls out Stripe, Calendly, Twilio/Firebase as preferred integrations ([Ficha técnica RED (1.7).pdf](file://file-9US1aVyd9pHfswAXWiY5Qn#:~:text=%F0%9F%94%B9%20Servicios%20e%20Integraciones)), confirming that these align well with the project’s goals of reliability and speed to market.

### 5. UX Best Practices for Mental Health Platform  
Designing the user experience for a mental health platform requires special attention to users’ emotional states and privacy concerns. Below are key UX principles and features RED will incorporate, drawn from industry best practices and competitor insights:

- **Minimize Friction and Fear:** Many potential users are anxious or hesitant about starting therapy, so the app must *reduce any intimidation*. This means a **clean, step-by-step onboarding** without overwhelming questionnaires on a single page. We’ll use friendly, non-technical language. For example, instead of a clinical question like “Do you exhibit symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder?”, we’d ask “What brings you here? (e.g., feeling anxious, feeling down, relationship issues, etc.)” in a casual tone. As one UX case study noted, major barriers that scare people from therapy include stigma, trust issues, and lack of knowledge ([Experience Redefined: 
“A UX Journey to Minimize 
Fear and Friction in Therapy” | by Karthi Durai | Medium](https://creativedesignlifee.medium.com/designing-joy-a-low-friction-therapist-booking-app-a-case-study-4b7f90f33374#:~:text=,Privacy%20concerns)), so our content will subtly address those. During onboarding, we might include microcopy like “It’s okay if you’re not sure how to describe what you feel – just give us a few keywords and we’ll guide you.” Providing reassurance (e.g. highlight that all therapists are licensed and vetted) can also ease trust issues.

- **Build Trust Early:** Trust is paramount – users need to trust the platform *and* the therapist. To foster this, RED will showcase **therapist profiles with rich information**. Profiles will include a photo, bio, credentials, and importantly, a short **intro video** of the therapist if possible. This idea (having a 5-10 second video introduction) can humanize the therapist – users can see and hear a bit of them, which research suggests helps users feel more comfortable ([Experience Redefined: 
“A UX Journey to Minimize 
Fear and Friction in Therapy” | by Karthi Durai | Medium](https://creativedesignlifee.medium.com/designing-joy-a-low-friction-therapist-booking-app-a-case-study-4b7f90f33374#:~:text=That%E2%80%99s%20why%20we%20have%20a,also%20builds%20trust%20on%20them)). Additionally, displaying any client reviews or testimonials (with anonymity preserved) can reassure users that others have had positive experiences. We will also prominently feature trust badges like “Certified Psychologist” (since we verify each therapist) and note compliance like “GDPR Compliant & Privacy Ensured” ([Ficha técnica RED (1.7).pdf](file://file-9US1aVyd9pHfswAXWiY5Qn#:~:text=%F0%9F%94%B9%20Fortalezas%20del%20Proyecto%20RED)) to address privacy concerns. 

- **Safety and Privacy Features:** Users should feel safe when sharing sensitive information. The UX will reflect this by, for example, allowing the client to choose whether to keep their camera off in a session initially if they are nervous (for video calls), or letting them use a nickname instead of full name in community forums. We will communicate privacy settings clearly: a user profile might have options like “Who can see my posts or profile” if forums are introduced. In sessions, obviously it’s one-on-one and confidential; we’ll never record without consent. We will also have an easily accessible **“Emergency Resources”** section (perhaps in the menu or as a button in chat), which lists hotlines and support for crises ([Casuísticas y emparejamiento.pdf](file://file-2HCxCqjTzrwCrJag5vLKvK#:~:text=6)) – this is a UX consideration showing users that if they are in severe distress, help is immediately at hand outside the app’s scope.

- **Guiding User Journey:** The flow from sign-up to starting therapy will be designed as an interactive journey. For instance, after registration, the app might present a progress tracker: *Step 1: Tell us about yourself → Step 2: Pick your therapist → Step 3: Start free intro call*. Each step will have a single clear action (with a large friendly button) to continue. By chunking the process, we avoid cognitive overload. If at any point the user drops off, we’ll use notifications to gently remind them to return and complete the step. For example, if someone registers but doesn’t schedule the intro session, an email a day later might say “Ready for your first free session? We’ll help you take that next step whenever you’re comfortable.”

- **A Calming Visual Design:** The UI should evoke calm and hope. We’ll use a soothing color scheme (soft blues, greens, or purples) as these are commonly associated with trust and calmness ([Experience Redefined: 
“A UX Journey to Minimize 
Fear and Friction in Therapy” | by Karthi Durai | Medium](https://creativedesignlifee.medium.com/designing-joy-a-low-friction-therapist-booking-app-a-case-study-4b7f90f33374#:~:text=Visual%20Design)). High-contrast mode and dark mode will be offered by Phase 3 for accessibility ([Ficha técnica RED (1.7).pdf](file://file-9US1aVyd9pHfswAXWiY5Qn#:~:text=%E2%9C%85%20Autenticaci%C3%B3n%20en%20dos%20pasos,2FA)), but the default will likely be a light theme with plenty of white space. Icons and illustrations will be gentle – for example, abstract shapes or friendly characters, avoiding anything too chaotic or overly clinical (no hospital icons!). Animations, if any, will be subtle and reassuring (like a loading spinner might be a small breathing circle animation to subtly encourage calm breathing while waiting).

- **Micro-interactions and Feedback:** To make the experience engaging and to reinforce positive actions, we’ll use supportive micro-interactions. When a user completes their profile or books a session, a little congratulatory message like “You’re all set!” or an encouraging quote could be displayed. If they hover over a therapist’s profile card, we might slightly highlight it or show a quick preview of the therapist’s approach (“Specialized in stress and mindfulness”) to invite clicking. All buttons and interactive elements will have hover and active states so the user gets immediate feedback (this is basic UX but builds a sense of reliability). Also, error messages will be phrased kindly – e.g., if a payment fails, instead of a generic “Transaction error”, it might say “Hmm, the payment didn’t go through. Check your card details or try a different method. We’re here to help if this keeps happening.”

- **Session Experience:** When it’s time for a session, the app will streamline the join process. A “Join Session” button will be highly visible on the dashboard when a session is about to start – possibly with a countdown or a change of state when it becomes active. We’ll ensure that joining a video call is one click (no complex meeting IDs to enter). After sessions, we might pop up a simple feedback: “How was your session?” with maybe a 5-star or a couple of smiley/frowny icons, to gather quick feedback without burden. This not only gives us data but also signals to the user that we care about their experience each time.

- **Therapist UX Considerations:** For therapists, the platform should be equally easy to use. Many may not be extremely tech-savvy, so we’ll keep their interface straightforward. Upon logging in, a therapist sees their schedule (today’s sessions, upcoming sessions), any new client match invitations, and any unread messages. Accepting a new client will be as simple as clicking a notification and confirming. We’ll use clear language here too, e.g., “New client seeking help with anxiety – available Wednesdays at 6pm. Accept this client?” and a single click to accept. We will provide a tutorial for therapists on first use, highlighting how to set availability, how to use the integrated video (or how to share a Zoom link if we use that), and how to mark a session as completed or report a no-show. There will also be an easy way for therapists to contact admin or support (perhaps a chat or a ticket system integrated) if they encounter any issue – this backchannel ensures they feel supported. 

- **Community UX:** When forums and group events launch, extra care is needed in design to maintain a safe atmosphere. We will likely require anonymity or allow pseudonyms for client users in forums. We’ll have clear community guidelines shown on first visit to the forum. The interface will allow users to easily report inappropriate content (with a simple flag icon on posts). Also, the forums will be organized by topic so users can find relevant threads without wading through off-topic chatter – organization and search is key in making a forum useful rather than stressful. In-app, it might resemble a feed or Q&A board, optimized for quick reading and posting.

- **Continuous Improvement via UX Research:** We will continually gather user feedback (through surveys, interviews, usability tests) and track usage analytics to identify pain points. For example, if we see many users start the intake but drop at the therapist match stage, we’ll investigate why – maybe the wait was too long or the instructions unclear. Then we refine that part of the UX. Our design must remain agile and user-centered.

In essence, the UX design for RED combines the **empathy of a therapist with the efficiency of modern app design**. By prioritizing user comfort, clarity, and control at each step, we create an environment where seeking help feels a bit easier. Competitors have demonstrated some of these principles (like building trust with credentials, or simplifying payment as Terapify did ([Terapify — M.](https://www.milimejia.com/work/terapify#:~:text=,complete%20their%20purchase%20more%20quickly))). RED will take these lessons and further weave in psychological UX considerations – ensuring the platform itself does not become an additional source of anxiety, but rather a **supportive digital space for healing**.

### 6. Recommended Libraries & Components (Node/React Stack)  
To implement the above with minimal friction, here is a list of suggested libraries and tools aligned with a Node/Express + React stack:

**Backend (Node.js) Libraries:**  
- **Express.js** – our web framework for routing and middleware. We’ll use express for creating REST endpoints (e.g. `POST /api/register`, `POST /api/match`, `GET /api/sessions` etc.). It’s lightweight and customizable.  
- **Express Validator or Joi** – for validating request data, especially important for security (e.g., ensure an incoming registration has a properly formed email, password meets criteria, etc.). Joi can define schemas for objects which is useful for complex forms (like intake questionnaire).  
- **Prisma ORM** – for database interactions. Prisma will allow us to define our schema in a schema file and auto-generate JS/TS client for queries. It will make complex queries (like fetching available therapists) easier to write and maintain. Alternatively, **Sequelize** or **TypeORM** could be used if the team is more familiar, but Prisma’s type safety is a plus.  
- **jsonwebtoken (JWT)** – for issuing and verifying JWTs for auth. We will likely use stateless JWT auth for APIs (access token stored in memory or httpOnly cookie). Passport.js with `passport-jwt` strategy could also be used to simplify auth middleware.  
- **bcryptjs** – for hashing passwords on user registration. Bcrypt is a reliable hashing algorithm to securely store passwords.  
- **Stripe Node SDK** – to interact with Stripe’s API for payments, creating checkout sessions, connecting accounts, and handling webhooks.  
- **Twilio Node SDK** – if using Twilio for SMS/WhatsApp or chat. Similarly, if using SendGrid for email, we’d use `@sendgrid/mail` package. If using Firebase, then `firebase-admin` SDK will be used on the backend to send push notifications or interact with the database.  
- **Socket.io** – if implementing real-time features in-house. We’d use socket.io on Node to manage real-time communication channels. Paired with the socket.io-client on React side. This is useful for live chat, instant notifications (e.g., therapist accepted your request – pop up in client’s app immediately).  
- **Multer or Cloud storage SDK** – for handling file uploads, if we allow profile pictures or exchange of documents. We might use AWS S3, so AWS SDK for Node would be integrated.  
- **Winston or Morgan** – for logging. Morgan can log HTTP requests (with status codes, response times) which is useful for monitoring. Winston for general app logging to files or external logging service.  
- **Jest + Supertest** – for testing the backend. We will write unit tests for critical functions (matching logic, etc.) and use Supertest to test API endpoints, ensuring they respond as expected with correct status codes and side effects. Ensuring our matching and payment flows work under various scenarios (including edge cases) via tests will improve reliability.  

**Frontend (React) Libraries:**  
- **React Router** – for client-side routing (login page, dashboard, chat page, forum page, etc.). Ensures we can have a multi-page app experience within the single-page app.  
- **Axios** – for making HTTP requests to our API. We’ll set up a global axios instance with baseURL and interceptors to attach auth tokens, etc., to simplify API calls from components.  
- **Redux Toolkit (optional)** – for global state management if needed. We can manage smaller state with React context, but for things like storing the logged-in user profile, or caching lists (like therapist list or forum posts) across components, Redux is a solid solution. The Toolkit reduces boilerplate and includes good defaults. If we use Redux, also consider **Redux Thunk or Saga** for side effects (Toolkit has Thunk built-in for async actions which might suffice).  
- **Material-UI (MUI)** – for a UI component library. MUI provides a comprehensive set of components like Buttons, TextFields, Modal dialogs, etc., with consistent styling. It also has theme support, so we can define a custom theme with our colors and have it apply app-wide. MUI components are accessible and responsive out of the box, which saves us a ton of effort. Alternatively, **Ant Design** or **Chakra UI** could be used; any of these modern UI kits would work, MUI is popular and well-documented.  
- **Styled Components or CSS Modules** – for custom styling beyond the component library. If we need to craft specific styles (like a custom branded header or certain layout), styled-components allows writing CSS in JS with scoping and theming. This is optional if MUI covers most needs with theming.  
- **React Hook Form** – for building forms in React. It’s performant and works well with controlled components. It will simplify intake forms, login form, etc., and easily show validation errors. We can integrate Yup for schema validation of form data.  
- **Socket.io-client** – if using socket.io for real-time, to receive events (like new chat message, or live updates if therapist is typing etc.). Alternatively, if using Firebase, we’d use the Firestore client SDK for real-time data.  
- **Day.js or date-fns** – for date/time manipulation and formatting. We will need to show dates (session times, etc.) in user’s locale format. These lightweight libraries can format dates nicely like “Monday, 5 Oct, 5:00 PM”. They also handle parsing ISO timestamps from the backend.  
- **FullCalendar React** – if down the line we implement an in-app calendar for scheduling, FullCalendar is a robust library to display availability and allow selecting slots. For MVP, maybe not needed due to Calendly, but if we drop Calendly, this is a great addition for therapists to manage schedule and for clients to pick slots visually.  
- **React Testing Library + Jest** – for testing React components. We’ll write tests for crucial components (like the intake form workflow, ensuring validation works; or the match notification component). This ensures our UI logic holds up as we change things.

**Development Utilities:**  
- **ESLint and Prettier** – to maintain code quality and consistency across the team.  
- **Husky + lint-staged** – to set up git hooks that run tests/linting before pushes, ensuring we catch problems early.  
- **Storybook** (optional) – for developing and visually testing UI components in isolation, especially if we go deep into custom components or want to document our UI for designers.

By using these libraries, we rely on well-maintained, community-tested solutions for common needs, letting the team focus on RED’s unique features (like the matching logic and community aspects) rather than low-level reinventing. The stack is intentionally chosen to be **developer-friendly and widely adopted**, so future developers joining the project can quickly get up to speed (most are likely familiar with React/Redux, Express, etc.). This also ensures long-term maintainability; there will be plenty of resources and updates for these libraries.

We also keep an eye on performance – libraries like React Hook Form are built for performance (avoiding unnecessary re-renders), and using proper state management will help the app remain snappy. For example, we’ll avoid storing huge lists in global state if not needed, and instead fetch on demand with caching as appropriate (maybe using SWR or React Query for data fetching caching could be an enhancement, but not required if we handle caching in Redux store).

In conclusion, this tech stack and library selection gives us **a solid foundation to implement RED quickly and correctly**, leveraging modern web development best practices and tools.

### 7. Security, GDPR, and Compliance  
Handling mental health data carries serious responsibility. RED must be secure by design and compliant with privacy regulations, particularly the EU’s GDPR since we operate in Spain and potentially other regions. Here’s how we will ensure data protection and compliance:

**Data Privacy & GDPR Compliance:** From the outset, we will implement measures to comply with GDPR. This includes:  
- **User Consent & Transparency:** During sign-up, users will agree to Terms of Service and Privacy Policy that clearly outline what data we collect and why. We’ll have a cookie consent banner if we use any tracking cookies. For any health-related info (which is sensitive personal data under GDPR), we will obtain explicit consent. For instance, if we have an intake question about mental health history, we will preface it with a note that by providing this info they consent to us storing it for matching purposes, etc.  
- **Right to Access and Erasure:** We will provide a way for users to request a copy of their data (likely via support request that our team can fulfill by exporting their records) and to delete their account. Account deletion will scrub personal identifying info from our database (except data we are legally obliged to keep, like payment records). We might keep anonymized aggregations but remove direct identifiers. This process will be outlined in the Privacy Policy and doable through account settings or contacting DPO (data protection officer).  
- **Data Minimization:** We will only collect data that is necessary for the service. For example, we won’t ask for a home address or national ID unless truly needed. Therapy notes between client and therapist won’t be accessible to anyone else, and we won’t unnecessarily log session contents. Any optional demographic questions (for internal analysis) will be clearly optional.  
- **Data Storage & Encryption:** All sensitive data in the database will be encrypted at rest. We’ll use PostgreSQL’s encryption or encrypt at the application layer for certain fields. Passwords are one-way hashed. For particularly sensitive fields (perhaps therapist notes or client’s personal health info if any stored), we could use an extra layer of encryption with a key that only the application (not even the DB admin) can use. In transit, all traffic will be HTTPS with TLS encryption (we’ll get SSL certificates via Let’s Encrypt or our cloud provider).  
- **Servers in Appropriate Regions:** We will host EU user data on EU servers. If using AWS, that means EU-West or similar regions. For third-party services, we’ll verify they have GDPR-compliant data processing (Stripe, Twilio, etc., all have GDPR compliance statements). We’ll sign Data Processing Addendums (DPAs) with them if required.  
- **Anonymization for Analytics:** If we do analytics on user behavior, we’ll avoid storing full IPs or any identifying info in analytics logs, or we’ll anonymize them. This reduces risk and compliance burden.

**Security Measures:**  
- **Authentication Security:** We’ll use industry-standard secure password policies (min length, complexity or passphrase). Protect against brute force by rate-limiting login attempts (Express-rate-limit or similar middleware). Implement 2FA (two-factor authentication) by Phase 3 for added account security ([Ficha técnica RED (1.7).pdf](file://file-9US1aVyd9pHfswAXWiY5Qn#:~:text=%E2%9C%85%20Emparejamiento%20Inteligente%20basado%20en,especializaci%C3%B3n%20y%20disponibilidad)) – possibly via an authenticator app or SMS code.  
- **Session Security:** If using JWT, we’ll have short-lived access tokens and refresh tokens stored HttpOnly cookies or secure storage, to prevent XSS from stealing them. We’ll implement proper CORS so only our domain can use the API with credentials.  
- **Input Sanitization:** All inputs (forms, query params) will be sanitized/escaped to prevent SQL injection, XSS, etc. Using prepared statements via ORM largely handles SQL injection. We’ll also sanitize outputs in React (React by default escapes content, preventing injection). We must be careful with any rich text in forums – likely we’ll either not allow HTML in posts or sanitize it server-side to strip scripts (using a library like DOMPurify).  
- **Access Control:** Enforce strict role-based access in the backend – e.g., only therapists can access therapist-specific endpoints, only an admin can moderate forums or view certain data. We’ll implement middleware that checks JWT roles and also object-level permissions (for instance, a client can only fetch their own sessions, not someone else’s).  
- **Audit Logging:** We will maintain logs of important actions (logins, password changes, data exports, etc.) so that if any suspicious activity occurs, we have an audit trail. For example, if a therapist accesses a client’s profile, maybe we log that (this might be overkill, but for internal audits it can be useful).  
- **Security Testing:** Before launch, we’ll conduct a security review or even hire a third-party to do a penetration test. We’ll also use automated vulnerability scanners (Dependabot for libs, maybe Snyk) to catch known vulnerabilities in dependencies.  
- **GDPR Data Security Principle:** We adhere to storing data securely. This includes regular backups of the database (with encryption) but also secure deletion – if a user deletes account, make sure data is truly purged from production and any backups eventually (with a retention policy). Also, ensure least privilege in our own team’s access: e.g., database access limited to senior devs or DPO, and production data not used in testing environments unless anonymized.

**Secure Communication & Video:** If we integrate video calls within RED, we will ensure they are encrypted streams. Using a vetted service like Twilio or Zoom ensures that. If chat messages are stored, we might consider end-to-end encryption for chat, but since therapists might need a record and we want the ability to moderate if abuse (and AI summaries), we likely will not E2E encrypt those (so that server can analyze content for moderation). Instead, we protect those by TLS in transit and encryption at rest. We will *never* data mine private chat contents for anything other than service improvement or safety (and if we did, would be with consent).

**Legal Compliance & Policies:** We will have a GDPR-compliant Privacy Policy and Terms of Use ready. As part of compliance, we’ll designate a representative in the EU (if needed) and a Data Protection Officer (which could be one of the founders for now, responsible for overseeing data practices). We’ll also address any specific local laws: for example, in Spain, online therapy platforms might need to ensure therapists are certified by the local college of psychologists; our verification step covers that ethically. If RED expands to handling any health insurance info or operating in the US, we’d consider HIPAA compliance, but as of scope, we stick to GDPR and similar frameworks in LATAM (which often mirror GDPR).

**Platform Misuse Prevention:** Security also extends to misuse. We will implement measures to prevent therapists and clients from circumventing the platform. For instance, our **terms prohibit exchanging personal contact info to take the relationship off-platform**. We might automatically monitor chat for phone numbers or emails (and warn/block if detected) ([Casuísticas y emparejamiento.pdf](file://file-2HCxCqjTzrwCrJag5vLKvK#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Estilo%20mensajer%C3%ADa%20instant%C3%A1nea)) – a bit like how some marketplaces do. This protects both privacy and our business model (ensuring further sessions go through the platform). Additionally, we’ll enforce community guidelines: any harassment or inappropriate behavior on forums or chat can lead to warnings or bans. Admin tools will allow quickly removing bad actors.

**Continuous Compliance:** GDPR is not a one-time task – we’ll keep up with any regulatory changes, maintain records of processing activities (basically document what data we store and for what purpose, as required by GDPR Article 30), and handle any data breaches responsibly (notification within 72h, etc., though we’ll strive to prevent breaches outright with the above measures).

In summary, **security and privacy are woven into every layer of RED’s blueprint**. By using trusted third-party services for payments and communications, we avoid many security pitfalls. By following best practices in development (secure coding, encryption, access control) and having clear policies, we create a platform that users and therapists can trust. Our ethical focus is a core strength – as noted, RED’s approach is *“ethical and safe, complying with international regulations (GDPR)”* ([Ficha técnica RED (1.7).pdf](file://file-9US1aVyd9pHfswAXWiY5Qn#:~:text=%F0%9F%94%B9%20Fortalezas%20del%20Proyecto%20RED)), and this will be a selling point to users who are rightly cautious about sharing their personal struggles online. 

---

With this blueprint, the RED team has a clear path forward to build a competitive online therapy platform that not only matches the features of existing players but exceeds them in community support, personalization, and ethical design. By prioritizing user-centric design, robust architecture, and smart automation, RED is poised to deliver a **psychologically comforting, technologically seamless** experience for clients and therapists alike – ultimately making mental health support more accessible across the Spanish-speaking world.
